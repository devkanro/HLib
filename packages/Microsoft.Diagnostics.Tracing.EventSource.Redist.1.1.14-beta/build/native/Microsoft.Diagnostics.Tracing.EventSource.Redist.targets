      This is a workaround to support installation of packages that depend on EventSource in all Windows Runtime 
      projects flavors (.NET, C++ and JavaScript).
    
      Although managed assembly references can be added to C# and Visual Basic projects directly from the lib folder, 
      NuGet cannot distinguish between managed and JavaScript project flavors and fails to add references from lib to 
      JavaScript projects on win8 and wpa81 platforms. NuGet also does not support adding managed references to C++ 
      projects (native platform).
